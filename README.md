# Exploit Host HTTP

Purpose made HTTP Docker file setup for hosting exploits for the web browser for Sony PlayStation devices and the Nintendo WiiU/Switch. This essentially has to be used with the [Exploit Host DNS](https://github.com/Al-Azif/exploit-host-DNS) component. It's possible to use it "standalone", but will require something to make the browser send the correct `Host` header with it's HTTP(S) requests.

## Features

When used in conjunction with [Exploit Host DNS](https://github.com/Al-Azif/exploit-host-DNS) following features are available:

- Enables internet speed tests
- Enables serving custom system updates
- Hijacks system update feature pages
- Hijacks default browser landing pages (Connection Tests, User's Manuals, and Browser Homepages)
  - Redirect is cached (It is not cached on PS5 as it becomes permanent)
  - Prepackaged with the latest Exploit Host website
  - Can redirect to an external page, to a self hosted site, or to the included Exploit Host website

## Usage

This is setup to work right out of the box with [Exploit Host DNS](https://github.com/Al-Azif/exploit-host-DNS). However there are lots of options for your individual hosting wants/needs. I'll only show the basic usage here.

### Command Line

This command will always pull the latest image from Docker Hub, run on the main Docker bridge network, and it will restart if it's not running until you explicitly tell it to stop.

`docker run -d --network bridge -p 80:80/tcp -p 443:443/tcp --restart unless-stopped --pull always alazif/exploit-host-http:latest`

### Composer

This composer file will do the same as the commands above.

```yml
---
version: "3.8"

services:
  exploit-host-http:
    image: alazif/exploit-host-http:latest
    network_mode: bridge
    ports:
      - 80:80/tcp
      - 443:443/udp
    pull_policy: always
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Start the compose file by calling `docker compose up -d` from the same location as the composer file.
